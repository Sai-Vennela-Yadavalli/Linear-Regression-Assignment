# 📈 Linear Regression – Assignment 🧠

This repository contains my assignment on **Linear Regression**, focusing on the foundational steps to train and test a linear regression model using Python and `scikit-learn`.

---

## 📘 What This Assignment Covers

- Importing necessary libraries (`pandas`, `sklearn`)
- Loading and preparing the dataset
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Fitting a **Linear Regression** model
- Predicting outcomes based on test data
- Displaying results (predictions and actual values)
